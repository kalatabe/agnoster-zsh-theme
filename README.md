# agnoster.zsh-theme
My customized version of the  [agnoster](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme) zsh theme originally bundled with oh-my-zsh.

Refer to the [project README](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme/blob/master/README.md) for installation and setup instructions before using this fork.

# Changes
 
- When in a git repo, the branch name will be shown on the right-hand side of the terminal
- The shell prompt itself will be on a new line, below the current path, to save line space for commands (I usually use narrow terminals)
- The shell prompt arrow uses [unicode 'SUCEEDS'](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/227b/index.htm) instead of a "greater-than" sign. Subtle, but pretty.
